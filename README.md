# ![icon](js.png) ![icon](js_disabled.png) Javascript Control
Fork of Erwan Ameil's [Javascript Control](https://github.com/idlewan/javascript-control)

This WebExtension adds a button in the url bar that allows you to disable or
re-enable Javascript quickly. It remembers the setting per-site. Differs from 
the original by providing option opt-out of Javascript (meaning defaults to
JS on) rtaher than opt-in (which the original add-on does). For former Chrome
users this provides a more familiar JS-blocking workflow.


# To Not Do (yet)
